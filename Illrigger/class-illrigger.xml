        <description>
			<p>The archdevils who rule the Seven Cities of Hell scheme and plot endlessly, eternally. Each seeks to bring the others to heel. To ascend to the Throne of Hell, unite the seven cities and every infernal thing that lives there, and lead an infinite army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn.</p>
			<p class="indent">Their elite shock troops, the terror-commandos of Hell, are the illriggers. Knights of Hell, they are charismatic counter-paladins who master devils, disrupt enemy organizations, and command Hell’s armies.</p>
			<h4>THE ORDER OF DESOLATION</h4>
            <p>Millennia ago, the Lords of Hell did something remarkable: they cooperated. They came together to create the Order of Desolation, knights sworn to serve Hell first, their patron archdevil second.</p> <p class="indent">Acceptance into the Order of Desolation makes you a comrade with every other illrigger, regardless of which archdevil you serve. Each archdevil has churches, underground fanes, secret societies, cults. All with leaders manically devoted to the archdevil who grants them their power. But this association of illriggers consider themselves above the petty political squabbles that divide the seven cities.</p>
			<p class="indent">Members of the Order of Desolation, also known as the Desolate, are expected to be intelligent, resourceful, tactical, manipulative. A temple or cult might conclude that the presence of an illrigger in their midst is a sign that their archdevil approves of their actions, but the illriggers are independent. The order was founded to give the Lords of Hell agents capable of acting across the timescape, free from the direct control of their patron. An illrigger has many powerful abilities granted by their archdevil, but more precious is their patron’s trust. Left to their own devices, the illrigger is expected to sow discord, pain, strife, deceit, and fear without instruction or supervision.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is not unusual, therefore, for a member of the Order of Desolation to rely on other members of the order first, even from illriggers who serve other archdevils, before going to any church, cult, or temple devoted to their own archdevil.</p>

			<p>There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with 1d10 at 1st level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the Illrigger table. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life force of enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality.</p>
			<P class="indent">As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. If you miss, nothing happens—you do not roll or lose dice from your pool. If you hit, or if you’re targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice.</P>
			<P class="indent">The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If you’re touching an ally, they gain that many hit points, ignoring any hit points in excess of their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number of hit points they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.</P>
			<P class="indent">If you’re touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you would gain hit points in excess of your maximum, you gain that number of temporary hit points instead.</P>

				You can summon a bone devil to serve you for 1 minute. The devil appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. It is bound to you and must obey your commands to the best of its ability. It acts on the same initiative that you act on, and may both act and move on the turn you summon it. If you die or fall unconscious, the devil returns to Hell. Once you use this feature, you must wait 1 week before you can use it again.

			<p>Dispater is the Lord of Dis, the City of War. When Hell invades another world, Dispater’s army does the fighting and the dying. His Painkillers are master strategists who lead from the front, inspiring terror and awe in their soldiers. They are full of pride and hubris and present themselves as lordly, often having a fastidious obsession with their personalappearance.</p>
			<P class="indent">The Painkillers are among the most chivalrous of the illriggers, but theirs is a twisted chivalry. They will accept and honor a challenge to single combat, and swiftly punish any who try to interfere. But they will cheat if losing and toy with an enemy before finishing them if winning.</P>
			<P class="indent">In a moment of weakness or desperation, a ruler in another World might see their army facing certain defeat and call upon Dispater. Seeing the opportunity to sow strife and discord, Dispater might send a Painkiller to lead the desperate lord’s armies.</P>
			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF PAIN</h5>
			<p>The Painkillers swear an oath to Dispater when they join the Order of Desolation. The oath commits them to lead Hell’s armies and wage war against Good across the timescape.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Lead from the Front.</em></strong> I am at the front of every battle. I charge in, inspiring my soldiers and causing fear in my enemy. I will not use stealth nor hide my face. Let them see their doom.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Victory at Any Cost.</em></strong> I respect the enemy leader and will treat them honorably. But once swords are drawn I will use every tool and trick in my arsenal to win, and they should do the same.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Soldiers Die.</em></strong> I care not for the lives of my soldiers, for they exist to serve my victory. They are resources to be spent.</p>

			<p>Asmodeus is the Lord of Acheron, the City of Fear. His illriggers scour the timescape collecting secrets and spells designed to deceive and terrify his opponents. The war he fights against the other Lords of Hell is one of deception and propaganda.</p>

			<p>When Asmodeus accepts you as an Architect of Ruin, you gain access to his infernal power and learn to access divine magic to cast illrigger spells.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5> 
			<p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the illrigger spell list. At 8th level, you learn an additional cantrip.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Architect of Ruin Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended spell slots.</p>
			<h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</h5> 
			<p>You prepare the list of illrigger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the illrigger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of illrigger spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your illrigger level (rounded down), minimum of one spell. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level illrigger, you have three 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Hell’s lash, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of illrigger spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
			<h5>Spellcasting Ability.</h5> 
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your illrigger spells, since your power derives from your ability to command the attention of your patron archdevil. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an illrigger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
